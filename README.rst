Black Swan (the waterbird)

Black Swan is a Python package with a collection of algorithms focussing on extreme weather event assessments available as a Web Processing Service (WPS).

Named for the reference to the black swan theory for unexpected extreme events

  *The term is based on an ancient saying which presumed black swans did not exist, but the saying was rewritten after black swans were discovered in the wild. [..].* (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory>`_).
